## Design ðŸ–¼
The design file for this project is [here](https://www.figma.com/file/rYww3hPWBX6OH2lBFFgHET/Sign-your-video?node-id=0%3A1)

## Frontend ðŸ’»
The frontend is built in ReactJS with the help of Material-UI to ensure homogeinity in the design.
The first page simply takes in a file & uploads it to a Cloudinary media library which returns a URL of the video this facilitates the handling of the files down the line

The second page shows the video that was uploaded and allows the user to input the information they'd like to add using a Formik form

## Backend ðŸ§ 
The backend is built with NodeJS and Express and uses the fmmpeg library to edit the metadata. <br></br>
Once the changes have been made to the video file it is hashed using SHA-256 and the value returned is stored as its filename , this hash can be used as evidence that the file has been tampered with in the future , if any changes are made to the video it will return a completely different hash once passed through SHA-256 once again.

Once the metadata changes and hashing are complete the new file is uploaded to Cloudinary and its URL is returned to the frontend to be downloaded.
